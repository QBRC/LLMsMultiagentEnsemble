Baseline artifact.  Probable atrial flutter with conducted beats and
ventricular premature beats.  Conducted complexes have leftward axis.
Low limb lead voltage.  Right bundle-branch block.  ST-T wave abnormalities.
Since the ___ the ventricular premature beats are new.
ST-T wave abnormalities are more prominent.
