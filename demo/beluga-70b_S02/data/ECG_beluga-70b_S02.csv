Baseline artifact.  Probable atrial flutter with conducted beats and
ventricular premature beats.  Conducted complexes have leftward axis.
Low limb lead voltage.  Right bundle-branch block.  ST-T wave abnormalities.
Since the ___ the ventricular premature beats are new.
ST-T wave abnormalities are more prominent.

ST-T wave abnormalities.   Since the ___ the ventricular premature beats are new.   ST-T wave abnormalities are more prominent.,Probable AF,0.95,"The report states 'Probable atrial flutter with conducted beats and ventricular premature beats,' indicating a high likelihood of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter with some degree of certainty. The estimated probability of AF (AF_pr) is 0.95, which is close to 1.0 due to the higher confidence expressed in the diagnosis.",AF
