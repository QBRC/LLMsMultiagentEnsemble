You will read an ECG report to be provided at the end. This report is among a series of ECG reports. Each ECG report contains a cardiologist's diagnosis of cardiac rhythms in one specific tracing, called "current tracing" in the report. Your task is to classify the cardiologist's diagnosis for the current tracing into five classes as follows: 

{
"AF_Diagnosis": ["AF","Probable AF","Possible AF","Non-AF","Not Specified"] 
}


1. "AF", if the report surely assesses the presence of atrial fibrillation (AFib) or atrial flutter (AFL) with complete certainty. Let AF be AFib OR AFL. In this class of cases, the estimated probability of AF (AF_pr) shall be 1.0. 
2. "Probable AF", if the report assesses AFib or AFL with higher confidence, where there is no secondary rhythm beyond AFib/AFL explicitly stated. In this class of cases, the report describes the primary rhythm as 'probable atrial fibrillation/flutter', 'most likely fibrillation/flutter', 'consistent with fibrillation/flutter', or other equivalent terms. In this class of cases, the estimated AF_pr could be smaller than 1.0 but close to 1.0, depending on the level of confidence shown in the cardiologist's diagnostic statements. 
3. "Possible AF", if the report assesses AFib or AFL with lower confidence, where AFib/AFL is among multiple possibilities of different cardiac rhythms. In this class of cases, the report may state as 'possible atrial fibrillation/flutter', "could/may be atrial fibrillation/flutter", "appears to be atrial fibrillation/flutter", "cannot excluded atrial fibrillation/flutter", or other equivalent terms. Based on the cardiologist's diagnostic statements, estimate a probability of AF (denoted as AF_pr); in most uncertain cases, the estimated AF_pr shall be 0.5. Please be aware that 1.0 corresponds to completely certain being AF, 0.50 represents most uncertain, and 0.0 for completely certain being "Not AF". 
4. "Non-AF", if the report identifies the cardiac rhythm as normal sinus rhythm or other arrhythmia rather than atrial fibrillation/flutter, such as 'atrial tachycardia', 'ventricular tachycardia', 'sinus bradycardia', and many others. In this class of cases, the estimated AF_pr shall be 0. 
5. "Not Specified", if no rhythm is directly described for the current tracing; instead, the report just simply refers to the previous tracing or report. 


Provide your answer in JSON data as follows. 

{
"AF_Diagnosis": "<select one from ['AF','Probable AF','Possible AF','Non-AF','Not Specified']>", 
"AF_pr": "<a number in [0,1] in two decimal places (e.g. 0.85), your estimated probability of the presence of AFib or AFL in the current tracing.>", 
"Explanation": "<text, to explan your answers with support of the evidence presented in the ECG report>" 
}


Please do remember that "probable atrial fibrillation (or atrial flutter)" is a case of "Probable AF" and it is NOT "Possible AF"; similarly, "possible atrial fibrillation (or atrial flutter)" is a case of "Possible AF" and it is NOT "Probable AF".  

Please output in a single JSON file and do not output anything else. Make sure the output JSON data is in legitimate JSON format. In your JSON output, ensure each value is embraced with a pair of straight double quotes; do not use any double quotation marks within the string of a value.
