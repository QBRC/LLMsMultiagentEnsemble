Baseline artifact.  Probable atrial flutter with conducted beats and
ventricular premature beats.  Conducted complexes have leftward axis.
Low limb lead voltage.  Right bundle-branch block.  ST-T wave abnormalities.
Since the ___ the ventricular premature beats are new.
ST-T wave abnormalities are more prominent.

ST-T wave abnormalities are more prominent.,Probable AF,0.85,"The ECG report states 'probable atrial flutter with conducted beats and ventricular premature beats'. The presence of conducted beats and ST-T wave abnormalities is suggestive of atrial flutter. However, the report does not explicitly state the presence of atrial fibrillation. Therefore, the diagnosis is classified as 'Probable AF'.",AF
