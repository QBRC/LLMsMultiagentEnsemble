  "comment": "The pathology report describes a left lung wedge resection with a 4.2 cm squamous cell carcinoma. The tumor does not involve the visceral pleura and has lymphovascular invasion. Thirteen regional lymph nodes are positive for metastatic carcinoma, corresponding to N2 disease. Based on these findings, the tumor is classified as T2N2Mx, which corresponds to Stage IIIA according to AJCC7 criteria."
