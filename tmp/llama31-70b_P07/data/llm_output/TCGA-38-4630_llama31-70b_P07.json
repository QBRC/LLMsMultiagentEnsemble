  "comment": "The pathology report describes a lung adenocarcinoma with poorly differentiated and focal papillary architecture. The tumor size is 4.5 cm in greatest dimension, and it directly involves a medium-sized bronchus. There is no metastatic carcinoma identified in the lymph nodes (0/7 total). Based on AJCC7 criteria, the estimated pT category is T2a, pN category is N0, and tumor stage is Stage IB."
