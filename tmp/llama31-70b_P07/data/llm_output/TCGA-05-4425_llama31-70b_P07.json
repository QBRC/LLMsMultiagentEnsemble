    "comment": "The pathology report describes a peripheral bronchopulmonary carcinoma of the lung with pleural invasion and a second small focus or satellite nodule. The tumor classification as adenocarcinoma of the lung is supported by immunohistochemical analysis, but requires confirmation. The presence of vascular invasion and endobronchial occlusion in a subsegmental branch of the bronchus suggests an aggressive tumor behavior."
