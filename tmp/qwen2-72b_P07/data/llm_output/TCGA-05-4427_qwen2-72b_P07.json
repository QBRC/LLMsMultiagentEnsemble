  "histologic_diagnosis_evidence": "The report describes a mixed large-cell and polymorphocellular adenocarcinoma, which is confirmed by immunohistochemical analysis.",
  "comment": "The pathology report indicates a primary peripheral lung carcinoma with predominant undifferentiated mixed large-cell and polymorphocellular adenocarcinoma features. It has invaded the visceral pleura minimally and shows lymph node metastases in central bronchopulmonary and hilar regions, while other removed lymph nodes are tumor-free. The immunohistochemical analysis confirms a high proportion of tumor cells positive for low molecular weight keratins and TTF1, supporting an adenocarcinoma diagnosis."
