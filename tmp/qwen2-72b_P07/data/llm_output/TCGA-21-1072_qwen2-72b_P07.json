  "comment": "The pathology report indicates a keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma grade II in the left lung with involvement of the left main bronchus and no evidence of tumor spread to lymph nodes or distant sites. The greatest dimension of the tumor is stated as 2.5 cm, which corresponds to pT2 category under AJCC7 criteria."
