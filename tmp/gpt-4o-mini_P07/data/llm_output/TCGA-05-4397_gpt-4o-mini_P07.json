  "comment": "The pathology report indicates a pT2, pN1 classification with a tumor stage of IIB. The tumor exhibits significant features such as invasion of large pulmonary vessels and pleura, which are critical for understanding the aggressiveness of the carcinoma. The histologic diagnosis suggests lung adenocarcinoma, although it notes mixed differentiation, which may require further clarification."
