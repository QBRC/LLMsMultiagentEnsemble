  "comment": "The pathology report indicates a diagnosis of poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma located in the left lingula, with a maximum tumor size of 4.2 cm. There is evidence of lymphovascular invasion and metastasis to regional lymph nodes (N2). The tumor is classified as T2 due to its size, leading to an overall stage of IIB. The margins are uninvolved by invasive carcinoma, which is a favorable prognostic factor."
