  "comment": "The pathology report indicates a mixed adenocarcinoma of the lung with pleural invasion and a small metastatic focus. The tumor is classified as pT2, pN0, and pM1, leading to a final stage IV diagnosis. The presence of vascular invasion and the characteristics of the tumor suggest aggressive behavior. Immunohistochemical analysis supports the diagnosis of lung adenocarcinoma."
