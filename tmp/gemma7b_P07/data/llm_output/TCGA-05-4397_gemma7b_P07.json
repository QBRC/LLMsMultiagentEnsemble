"comment": "The tumor invasion of the large pulmonary vessels with formation of lumen-obstructing thrombi of polypoid growth extending beyond the resection margin is very unusual.. The wall adhesion of the carcinoma is minimally about 0.5 mm from the resection margin of the vessels. The RX situation is likely explained by the fact that the tumor plug causing intraluminal obstruction of the middle lobe also adheres to the wall at a site on the resection margin. In addition, the tumor invasion in the pleura extends focally as far as the surface of the pleura. The glandular maturation component is partly reminiscent of the fetal type of bronchopulmonary adenocarcinoma. The smoldering or recurrent pneumonia is likely to have been of retrostenotic origin."
