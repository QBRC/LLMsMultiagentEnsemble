"comment": "The tumor classification as adenocarcinoma of the lung showing a predominantly tubulopapillary structural pattern still requires confirmation by appropriate immunohistochemical analysis. The classification of the second small tumor focus as a (hematogenous) metastasis that – despite a certain difference in histoarchitecture and cell morphology in places – is based on the structure of the focus, which is lacking the fibrous remodeling or cicatricial zone here that is characteristic of a primary peripheral bronchopulmonary carcinoma."}
