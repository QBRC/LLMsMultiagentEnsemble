  "comment": "The pathology report describes a peripheral bronchopulmonary mixed adenocarcinoma with pleural invasion and a satellite nodule considered a metastasis. The tumor is classified as pT2, pN0, and pM1 (pulmonary metastasis), resulting in Stage IV disease per AJCC7 criteria. Immunohistochemistry supports the diagnosis of lung adenocarcinoma. Tumor size is not provided, limiting size-based staging refinement. The R1 resection status indicates tumor cells at the pleural surface, suggesting incomplete resection. Overall, the report provides sufficient data for staging except for tumor size measurement."
