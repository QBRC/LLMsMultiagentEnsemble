  "comment": "The pathology report describes a high-grade (G3) lung adenocarcinoma with mixed differentiation, involving large pulmonary vessels and pleura, with partial necrosis and lymph node involvement (N1). The tumor is classified as pT2 pN1, stage IIB according to AJCC 7th edition. The tumor size is not specified. The report notes unusual tumor invasion of pulmonary vessels with thrombi extending to the resection margin, which may impact surgical margins and prognosis. The RX (resection margin) status is uncertain due to tumor adherence at the vessel margin. Overall, the report provides sufficient information for staging except for tumor size measurement."
