  "comment": "The pathology report describes a mixed bronchopulmonary adenocarcinoma completely excised by wedge resection. The tumor is classified as pT1, pN0, R0 with stage IA according to AJCC7 criteria. Lymph nodes and margins are tumor-free. Tumor size dimension is not provided. Immunohistological confirmation is pending. Overall, the report supports early-stage lung adenocarcinoma with complete resection and no nodal involvement."
