  "comment": "The pathology report describes a large peripheral to central, predominantly undifferentiated mixed large-cell and polymorphocellular adenocarcinoma of the left upper lobe of the lung. The tumor is classified as pT2 due to minimal visceral pleura invasion and pN1 due to central bronchopulmonary and hilar lymph node metastases, with no distant metastasis mentioned. The tumor stage is IIB per AJCC7 criteria. Immunohistochemistry supports adenocarcinoma diagnosis with TTF1 positivity and keratin expression. Tumor size is not provided, limiting size-based staging refinement. Overall, the report is comprehensive but would benefit from explicit tumor size measurement and confirmation of neuroendocrine differentiation status once immunohistochemistry is complete."
