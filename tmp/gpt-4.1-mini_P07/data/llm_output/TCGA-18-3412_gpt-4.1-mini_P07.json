Tumor invades peribronchial fatty tissue and lobar bronchus but no mention of invasion of visceral pleura or main bronchus <2 cm from carina. Pleura is intact but tumor extends beyond pleura into soft tissue adjacent to bronchus. AJCC7 T2a includes tumor >3 cm and ≤5 cm or tumor with invasion of visceral pleura. The report states pleura intact but tumor extends beyond pleura into ragged soft tissue adjacent to bronchus, which may be peribronchial tissue invasion consistent with T2. No evidence of main bronchus involvement <2 cm from carina or other T3/T4 features. Hence T2a is estimated.",

  "comment": "The pathology report describes a moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the left lower lobe lung with a maximum tumor diameter of 4.7 cm. The tumor invades peribronchial fatty tissue and lobar bronchus but the pleura is intact. Multiple lymph nodes from various stations are negative for malignancy. Bronchial resection margin was initially positive but negative on completion pneumonectomy. Based on tumor size and nodal status, the tumor is staged as pT2a N0 M0, corresponding to AJCC7 Stage IB. The report is comprehensive with multiple lymph node stations sampled and clear description of tumor extent. The main limitation is lack of explicit mention of distant metastasis (M status), but clinical history and report imply no distant spread. Overall, the diagnosis and staging are well supported."
