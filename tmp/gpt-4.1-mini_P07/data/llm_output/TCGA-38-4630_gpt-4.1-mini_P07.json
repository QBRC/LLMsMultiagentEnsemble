  "comment": "The pathology report describes a poorly differentiated lung adenocarcinoma in the right upper lobe measuring 4.5 cm in greatest dimension. The tumor involves a medium sized bronchus and shows focal pleural margin involvement but no direct visceral pleural invasion. Angiolymphatic invasion is present. Surgical margins are negative except for focal pleural margin involvement. Seven lymph nodes from stations 7, R9, and R10 are negative for metastasis. Based on tumor size and nodal status, the tumor is staged as pT2a N0, corresponding to Stage IB by AJCC 7th edition criteria. The report is comprehensive and provides sufficient data for accurate staging. No distant metastasis information is provided, so M category and overall stage IV cannot be assessed. The presence of angiolymphatic invasion may have prognostic implications. Overall, the report supports a diagnosis of Stage IB lung adenocarcinoma with no nodal metastasis."
