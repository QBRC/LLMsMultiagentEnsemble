  "comment": "The pathology report describes a 2.5 cm keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma in the left lung pneumonectomy specimen with involvement of the left main bronchus but negative margins and no lymph node metastasis (0/9 nodes). The tumor is staged as pT2a N0, corresponding to Stage IIA by AJCC 7th edition criteria. No tumor was identified in the rib specimen or lymph nodes sampled from levels 5, 7, and 9. The bronchial margin is negative. The report is comprehensive and provides sufficient information for accurate staging. The only minor uncertainty is the exact bronchial involvement extent, but the stated PT2 supports T2a classification. Overall, the diagnosis and staging are well supported."
