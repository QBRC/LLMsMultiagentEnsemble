  "comment": "The pathology report indicates a mixed bronchopulmonary adenocarcinoma that has been completely removed with no evidence of tumor in the resection margins or lymph nodes. The tumor is classified as pT1, pN0, and stage IA, indicating an early stage of lung cancer. Further confirmation through immunohistological investigations is pending."
