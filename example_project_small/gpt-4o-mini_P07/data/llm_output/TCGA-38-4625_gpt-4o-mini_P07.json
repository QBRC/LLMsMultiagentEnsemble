  "comment": "The pathology report indicates a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma located in the right upper lobe with a maximum tumor size of 5.0 cm. All examined lymph nodes are free of tumor, supporting a diagnosis of N0. The tumor is classified as T2, leading to an overall stage of IIB according to AJCC 7th edition criteria. The surgical margins are free of tumor, indicating a favorable outcome in terms of local control."
