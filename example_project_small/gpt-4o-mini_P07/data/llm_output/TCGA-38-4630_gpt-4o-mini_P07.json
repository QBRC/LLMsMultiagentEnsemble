  "comment": "The pathology report indicates a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma of the right upper lobe with a maximum tumor size of 4.5 cm. There is no lymph node involvement, and the tumor is classified as T2, leading to a final staging of Stage IIA. The bronchial margin is not involved, but there is focal pleural involvement. Overall, the findings suggest a localized tumor without metastasis."
