  "comment": "The pathology report indicates an extensive and locoregionally advanced mixed adenocarcinoma of the right lower lobe with pleural invasion and lymph node metastasis. The tumor is classified as pT4, pN1, and stage IV, confirming its advanced nature. The histological analysis supports the diagnosis of lung adenocarcinoma with mixed differentiation. Further immunohistochemical analysis is pending to confirm the bronchopulmonary origin and rule out late metastatic spread from breast carcinoma."
