  "comment": "The pathology report indicates an extensive and locoregionally advanced lung adenocarcinoma with pleural invasion and lymph node metastasis, classified as pT4 pN1 pM1, corresponding to stage IV. The tumor shows mixed differentiation with glandular and bronchioloalveolar characteristics. Immunohistochemical analysis supports the diagnosis, confirming the tumor's bronchopulmonary origin."
