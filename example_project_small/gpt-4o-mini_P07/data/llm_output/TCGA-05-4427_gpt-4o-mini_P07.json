  "comment": "The pathology report indicates a large peripheral to central undifferentiated mixed large-cell and polymorphocellular adenocarcinoma of the left upper lobe, classified as pT2 and pN1, leading to a final stage of IIB. The tumor shows some neuroendocrine differentiation and has invaded the visceral pleura minimally, with central bronchopulmonary and hilar lymph node metastases. Immunohistochemical analysis supports the diagnosis of mixed-type adenocarcinoma."
