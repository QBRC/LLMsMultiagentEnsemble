  "comment": "The pathology report indicates a large peripheral to central undifferentiated mixed large-cell and polymorphocellular adenocarcinoma of the left upper lobe, classified as pT2 and pN1, resulting in a stage IIB classification. The tumor shows evidence of invasion and lymph node metastases, confirming its aggressive nature. Immunohistochemical analysis supports the diagnosis, indicating a primary lung carcinoma."
