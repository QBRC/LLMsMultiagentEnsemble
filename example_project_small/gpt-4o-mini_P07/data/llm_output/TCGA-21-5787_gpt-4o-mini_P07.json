  "comment": "The pathology report indicates a diagnosis of poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma located in the left lingula, with a maximum tumor dimension of 4.2 cm. There is significant lymph node involvement (N2), leading to a classification of Stage IIB according to AJCC 7th edition criteria. The report also notes lymphovascular invasion, which may have implications for prognosis."
