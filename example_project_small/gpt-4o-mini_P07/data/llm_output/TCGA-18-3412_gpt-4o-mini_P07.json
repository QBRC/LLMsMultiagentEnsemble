  "comment": "The pathology report indicates a diagnosis of moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the left lung with a maximum tumor size of 4.7 cm. The tumor is staged as pT2N0, leading to a final stage classification of Stage IIB. The lymph nodes examined were negative for malignancy, indicating no regional spread. The bronchial resection margin was positive for tumor involvement, which is critical for treatment considerations."
