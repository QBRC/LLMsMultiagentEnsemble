  "comment": "The pathology report indicates a diagnosis of moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the left lung with a maximum tumor size of 4.7 cm. The tumor has invaded peribronchial fatty tissue but lymph nodes are negative for malignancy, leading to a classification of pT2N0 and a final staging of Stage IIA. The report suggests a complete surgical resection with no residual tumor in the bronchial resection margin."
