  "comment": "The pathology report indicates a mixed adenocarcinoma of the lung with pleural invasion and a small metastatic focus. The tumor is classified as pT2, pN0, and pM1, leading to a final stage of IV. The report highlights the need for immunohistochemical confirmation of the tumor type, but the findings strongly support the diagnosis of lung adenocarcinoma."
