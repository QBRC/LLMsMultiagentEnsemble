  "comment": "The pathology report indicates a pT2, pN1 classification with a tumor stage of IIB. The tumor exhibits extensive invasion characteristics, including involvement of large pulmonary vessels and the pleura, which is significant for staging. The histologic diagnosis is confirmed as Lung Adenocarcinoma. The report highlights unusual features such as lumen-obstructing thrombi and minimal wall adhesion, which may have clinical implications."
