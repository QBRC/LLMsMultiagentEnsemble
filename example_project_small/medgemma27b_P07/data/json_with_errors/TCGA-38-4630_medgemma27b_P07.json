  "comment": "The patient underwent a right upper lobe lobectomy for non-small cell lung carcinoma. The final diagnosis is poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma, measuring 4.5 cm in greatest dimension. The tumor involves a medium sized bronchus but the bronchial margin is negative. The pleural margin is focally involved. No lymph node metastasis was identified in 7 lymph nodes examined. The tumor stage is IIA based on AJCC 7th edition criteria (pT2a N0). The presence of angiolymphatic invasion is noted."
