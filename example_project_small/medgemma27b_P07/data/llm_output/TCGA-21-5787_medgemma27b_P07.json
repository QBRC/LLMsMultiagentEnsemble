  "comment": "The patient has a poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the left lingula measuring 4.2 cm. There is lymphovascular invasion. The tumor does not involve the visceral pleura. The margins are uninvolved except for the vessel margin where carcinoma is present but the vessel wall is not involved. There is metastasis to 13 ipsilateral mediastinal and/or subcarinal lymph nodes (N2). The final pTNM stage is T2 N2 Mx, corresponding to Stage IIB."
