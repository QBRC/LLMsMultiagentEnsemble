  "comment": "The patient underwent left lower lobe lobectomy and completion left pneumonectomy for lung cancer. The final diagnosis is moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma. The tumor size is 4.7 cm. The tumor invaded into peribronchial fatty tissue and the bronchial resection margin was positive for tumor involvement, suggesting T2b stage. Lymph nodes examined (interlobar ST11, lobar ST12, lobar/segmental peribronchial nodes, aorta-pulmonary ST5) were negative for malignancy, suggesting N0 stage. Based on AJCC 7th edition criteria, the tumor stage is IIB (T2b N0 M0). The report mentions T2NO, but the description of invasion into peribronchial fatty tissue and positive bronchial resection margin points towards T2b."
