  "comment": "The pathology report describes a histologically mixed adenocarcinoma of the right lower lobe of the lung, classified as pT4 pN1 pM1 (P/E) V1 RX, stage IV. The tumor shows pleural invasion and metastatic dissemination to both pleural layers and lymph nodes. The immunohistochemical analysis confirms the diagnosis of lung adenocarcinoma. The RX category is due to the possibility of residual carcinoma cells in the pleural effusions."
