  "pT_evidence": "The final diagnosis states PT2NO. According to AJCC 7th edition, T2 is defined as >3 cm but ≤5 cm in greatest dimension OR tumor involving the main bronchus, whatever the distance from the carina. The report states the tumor size is 2.5 cm and involves the left main bronchus. T2 is further subdivided into T2a (>3 cm but ≤4 cm) and T2b (>4 cm but ≤5 cm). Since the tumor size is 2.5 cm, it does not fit the size criteria for T2a or T2b. However, the report explicitly states involvement of the left main bronchus. According to AJCC 7th edition, involvement of the main bronchus is classified as T2. The report states PT2NO, which implies T2. Given the size is 2.5 cm and involves the main bronchus, it is classified as T2. The report does not specify T2a or T2b, but based on the size (2.5 cm), it is likely T1b if it did not involve the main bronchus. However, the involvement of the main bronchus overrides the size criteria and makes it T2. Since the size is 2.5 cm, it is T2. The report states PT2NO, which is consistent with T2. The report does not specify T2a or T2b, but based on the size (2.5 cm), it is likely T1b if it did not involve the main bronchus.
