The tumor is peripheral and does not invade the visceral pleura. All examined regional lymph nodes (paratracheal, subcarinal, inferior pulmonary ligament, and lobar nodes) are negative for malignancy. The final diagnosis is consistent with a pT2a N0 tumor. Based on AJCC 7th edition staging, this corresponds to Stage IIA, assuming no distant metastasis. The resection margins are negative."
