  "comment": "The patient underwent a right upper lobe lobectomy for non-small cell lung carcinoma. The final diagnosis is poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma, measuring 4.5 cm in greatest dimension. The tumor involves a medium sized bronchus and focally involves the pleura. Seven lymph nodes were examined, and none contained metastatic carcinoma. The tumor stage is IIA based on AJCC 7th edition criteria (pT2a N0). The bronchial margin is negative, but the pleural margin is focally involved."
