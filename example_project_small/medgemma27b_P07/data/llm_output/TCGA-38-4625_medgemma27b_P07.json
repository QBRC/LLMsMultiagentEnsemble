  "comment": "The patient underwent a right upper lobe lobectomy for a right upper lobe mass. The final diagnosis is poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma, measuring 5.0 cm in greatest dimension. The tumor is located peripherally and abuts the pleura without invasion. Surgical margins are free of tumor. Four regional lymph nodes were examined and were negative for tumor. Based on AJCC 7th edition criteria, the tumor is staged as pT2a N0, Stage IIA."
