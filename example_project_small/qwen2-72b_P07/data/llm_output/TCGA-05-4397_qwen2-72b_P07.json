  "comment": "The pathology report indicates an extensive bronchopulmonary adenocarcinoma with mixed differentiation, classified as pT2 and pN1. The tumor invades large pulmonary vessels and pleura, leading to a stage IIB classification according to AJCC7 criteria. Unusual findings include invasion of the large pulmonary vessels causing lumen-obstructing thrombi extending beyond the resection margin."
