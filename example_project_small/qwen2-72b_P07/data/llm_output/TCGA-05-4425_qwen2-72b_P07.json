"comment": "The pathology report details a lung adenocarcinoma with pT2 classification indicating a tumor size greater than 3 cm but not more than 5 cm in greatest dimension, no regional lymph node metastasis (pN0), and distant metastasis (pM1) to the pleura. The histologic diagnosis is confirmed by immunohistochemical analysis showing CK7 positivity throughout, TTF1 positivity, and negativity for CK20."
