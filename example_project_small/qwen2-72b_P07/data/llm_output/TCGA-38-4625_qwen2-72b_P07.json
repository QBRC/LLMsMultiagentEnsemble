  "comment": "The pathology report details a right upper lobe lobectomy for a lung mass, revealing a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma measuring 5.0 cm in greatest dimension. Surgical margins and examined lymph nodes are free of tumor. The high-grade nature of the tumor is noted with rare mucin-positive cells, supporting an adenocarcinoma diagnosis."
