"comment": "The pathology report describes a large peripheral to central, histologically predominantly undifferentiated mixed large-cell and polymorphocellular adenocarcinoma of the left upper lobe of the lung. TNM classification on the basis of this material pT2 pN1 R0, stage IIB. C34.1 M8255/3, G3.  Comment/supplementary remark:  Histologically, the large-cell and polymorphocellular solid component of the carcinoma predominates, with a clear-cell appearance in small sections and the possibility of a neuroendocrine differentiation (immunohistochemical analysis to follow). In all likelihood, it is a primary peripheral carcinoma of the lung that has invaded the overlying visceral pleura to a minimal extent and also shows central bronchopulmonary and hilar lymph node metastases.  The other hilus lymph nodes and other lymph nodes removed are tumor-free  Result of immunohistochemical analysis. A high proportion of tumor cells positive for low molecular weight keratins             and a small proportion also for high molecular weight keratins            Relatively high proportion positive for TTF1. Negative for synaptophysin  and NCAM.  The tumor classification of mixed-type adenocarcinoma of the lung is thus confirmed."
