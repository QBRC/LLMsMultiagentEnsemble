Mixed bronchopulmonary adenocarcinoma.
Comment/supplementary remark: histoarchitecture and cell morphology of the tumor are
consistent with a bronchopulmonary origin of the tumor. This will be reviewed and confirmed
in immunohistological investigations. The tumor is completely removed by wedge excision of
sample 1.). The visceral pleura, the right upper lobe of sample 2.), including its resection
margin of the bronchus and vessels and all the lymph nodes removed are tumor-free. On the

Comment/supplementary remark:
The tumor invasion of the large pulmonary vessels with formation of lumen-obstructing
thrombi of polypoid growth extending beyond the resection margin is very unusual.. The wall
adhesion of the carcinoma is minimally about 0.5 mm from the resection margin of the
vessels. The RX situation is likely explained by the fact that the tumor plug causing
intraluminal obstruction of the middle lobe also adheres to the wall at a site on the resection
margin. In addition, the tumor invasion in the pleura extends focally as far as the surface of
the pleura. The glandular maturation component is partly reminiscent of the fetal type of
bronchopulmonary adenocarcinoma. The smoldering or recurrent pneumonia is likely to have
been of retrostenotic origin. The lymph node with tumor is located in the hilus region
immediately next to one of the tumor-infiltrated large pulmonary vessels

C34.2 M8255/3.
Comment/supplementary remark:
The tumor classification as adenocarcinoma of the lung showing a predominantly
tubulopapillary structural pattern still requires confirmation by appropriate
immunohistochemical analysis. The classification of the second small tumor focus as a
(hematogenous) metastasis that – despite a certain difference in histoarchitecture and cell
morphology in places – is based on the structure of the focus, which is lacking the fibrous
remodeling or cicatricial zone here that is characteristic of a primary peripheral
bronchopulmonary carcinoma. Vascular invasion can be seen in the intratumoral, thick-walled
pulmonary vessels of the larger tumor, where there is tumor spread with endobronchial
occlusion in a subsegmental branch of the bronchus. The R1 classification is explained by the
observation that the tumor glands invading the pleura extend as far as the outer surface of the
pleura in places and the tumor cells thus remain in the pleural space.
Result of immunohistochemical analysis (both tumor foci)
CK7 positive throughout, CK20 negative. TTF1.positive (in the smaller focus more than in
the larger one), only isolated tumor cells with delicate cell membrane staining for surfactant
protein B.
This not only confirms that it is an adenocarcinoma of the lung and, but also supports the
view that the smaller focus represents the metastasis of the larger focus
seen in 1.) and classified as primary tumor.

Comment/supplementary remark:
Histologically, the large-cell and polymorphocellular solid component of the carcinoma
predominates, with a clear-cell appearance in small sections and the possibility of a
neuroendocrine differentiation (immunohistochemical analysis to follow). In all likelihood, it
is a primary peripheral carcinoma of the lung that has invaded the overlying visceral pleura to
a minimal extent and also shows central bronchopulmonary and hilar lymph node metastases.

Result of immunohistochemical analysis. A high proportion of tumor cells positive for low

Comment/supplementary remark:
Within the main tumor and the lymph node metastases, which are found within the lung in the
parabronchial region, at the hilus and in sample 5, the large-cell solid tumor component,
which has a partly clear-cell character, is predominant. Especially in the area of the main
tumor margin and the surrounding area the carcinoma shows glandular tubulopapillary and
bronchioloalveolar differentiation. No maturation pattern of squamous epithelium is evident
on conventional histology (immunohistochemical analysis will follow to provide as definitive
confirmation as possible of the bronchopulmonary origin of the tumor and thus exclusion of a
late metastatic spread of the reported breast carcinoma). The RX category is explained by the
fact that the tumor infiltrating the pleura and disseminated there extends as far as the pleural
surface and, with the detection of carcinoma cells in the pleural effusions, the possibility
cannot be excluded that some of them remained there. The central bronchus resection line and
the resection margins of the large pulmonary vessels and the resection preparation of parietal
pleura itself, as registered under 4., are tumor-free
Result of immunohistochemical analysis: a major part of the tumor cells with double
expression of low and high molecular weight keratins (M903 and 902). In the glandular
differentiation component, tumor cell nuclei are positive TTF1.
The immune profile confirms the diagnosis of an adenocarcinoma of the lung of mixed
differentiation.

adjacent to the bronchus there is ragged soft tissue adhered. On the
medial anterior aspect extending from the apex to the inferior aspect
there is a staple line margin measuring 14.0 em long. The bronchial
resection margin is examined at intraoperative consultation by frozen

measuring 4.7 em in maximum diameter. The mass is solid tan-white with
some gray-black qtiery segmental lymph nodes admixed. Grossly the tumor
appears to extend beyond the pleura and into the overlying ragged area of
soft tissue which is adja.cent to the bronchus. In this area the soft
tissue is painted with silver nitrate. The tumor invades into the lobar
bronchus and into the segmental bronchi. The tumor is also 2.0 em away
from the staple line resection margin. The rest of the lung parenchyma
ranges from unremarkable to mildly emphysematous with more prominence at
the apex. Four pieces of tumor and four pieces of grossly normal lung
  'renchyma are taken for tissue banking.
