    "comment": "The pathology report describes a left pneumonectomy with a tumor measuring 2.4 x 2.5 cm in greatest dimension, involving the left main bronchus. The tumor is classified as a Keratinizing Squamous Cell Carcinoma Grade II. The pleura, bronchial and vascular margins are negative for tumor. There are no lymph nodes involved (0/9). Based on these findings, the estimated pT category is T2a, pN category is N0, and the tumor stage is Stage IB."
