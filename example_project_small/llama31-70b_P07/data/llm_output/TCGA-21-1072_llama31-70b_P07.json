    "comment": "The pathology report describes a left pneumonectomy with a keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma grade II, measuring 2.4 x 2.5 cm in greatest dimension. The tumor is located in the left main bronchus and has not invaded the pleura, bronchial, or vascular margins. Nine peribronchial lymph nodes are negative for tumor. The tumor stage is estimated to be Stage IB according to AJCC7 criteria."
