  "comment": "The pathology report describes a poorly differentiated lung adenocarcinoma in the right upper lobe measuring 4.5 cm in greatest dimension. The tumor focally involves the pleural margin but does not involve the bronchial margin. Angiolymphatic invasion is present. No lymph node metastases were identified in 7 nodes examined. Based on tumor size and nodal status, the tumor is staged as T2a N0, corresponding to Stage IB by AJCC 7th edition criteria. The report is comprehensive with clear tumor measurements and nodal assessment. Pleural involvement is focal but present, supporting T2 classification. No distant metastasis information is provided, so M category and overall stage IV cannot be assigned. Overall, the report provides sufficient data for confident staging and diagnosis."
