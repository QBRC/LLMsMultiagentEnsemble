  "comment": "The pathology report describes a large peripheral to central mixed large-cell and polymorphocellular adenocarcinoma of the left upper lobe with minimal visceral pleura invasion and central bronchopulmonary and hilar lymph node metastases (pN1). Immunohistochemistry supports adenocarcinoma diagnosis. The tumor is staged as pT2 pN1 R0, stage IIB according to AJCC7 criteria. Tumor size is not provided, limiting size-based staging refinement. Overall, the report is comprehensive with clear histologic and staging information, but tumor dimension data would improve completeness."
