  "comment": "The pathology report describes a high-grade (G3) bronchopulmonary adenocarcinoma with mixed differentiation, including tubuloglandular and fetal-type glandular components. The tumor shows invasion into large pulmonary vessels with thrombus formation and pleural involvement. Lymph node metastasis is present in the hilus region (pN1). The tumor is staged as pT2 pN1, corresponding to Stage IIB by AJCC 7th edition criteria. The resection margin status is RX due to tumor thrombus extending to the margin. The report highlights unusual vascular invasion and pleural surface involvement, which may impact prognosis and surgical management."
