  "comment": "The pathology report describes a poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the left lingula measuring 4.2 cm with lymphovascular invasion but no visceral pleura involvement. Multiple regional lymph nodes, including ipsilateral mediastinal and subcarinal nodes, show metastatic carcinoma consistent with N2 disease. The rib specimen shows no tumor. Margins are uninvolved. The tumor is staged as T2a N2 Mx, corresponding to Stage IIIA lung squamous cell carcinoma per AJCC 7th edition. The report is comprehensive and provides sufficient data for accurate staging. No distant metastasis evaluation is provided (Mx). The presence of lymphovascular invasion and multiple positive lymph nodes indicates aggressive disease. Further clinical correlation and imaging are needed to assess distant metastasis."
