  "comment": "The pathology report describes a poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the left lingula measuring 4.2 cm with lymphovascular invasion but no visceral pleura involvement. Multiple ipsilateral mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes are positive for metastatic carcinoma, consistent with N2 disease. The rib specimen shows no tumor involvement. Margins are uninvolved by invasive carcinoma. Based on AJCC 7th edition criteria, the tumor is staged as T2a N2 Mx, corresponding to Stage IIIA. The report is comprehensive with detailed lymph node assessment and margin evaluation. No distant metastasis information is provided (Mx). The tumor size and nodal status are well documented, supporting a confident staging. The presence of lymphovascular invasion and multiple positive lymph nodes indicates aggressive disease requiring multidisciplinary management."
