  "comment": "The pathology report describes a 3.5 cm invasive, poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma in the left lower lobe wedge biopsy with negative pleural and resection margins. One sampled lymph node (level 9L) is negative for metastasis. The tumor is staged as pT2a N0, corresponding to Stage IB by AJCC 7th edition criteria. The report is comprehensive with clear gross and microscopic findings. No evidence of nodal or distant metastasis is noted. The diagnosis and staging appear reliable with high certainty."
