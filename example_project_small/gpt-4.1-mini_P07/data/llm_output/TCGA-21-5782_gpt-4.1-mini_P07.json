  "comment": "The pathology report describes a 3.5 cm invasive, poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma in the left lower lobe wedge biopsy with negative pleural and resection margins. One sampled lymph node (level 9L) is negative for metastasis. The tumor is staged as T2a N0, corresponding to Stage IB by AJCC 7th edition criteria. The report is comprehensive with clear tumor size and lymph node status, allowing confident staging. No evidence of distant metastasis is provided. The diagnosis is consistent with lung squamous cell carcinoma. No critical issues noted."
