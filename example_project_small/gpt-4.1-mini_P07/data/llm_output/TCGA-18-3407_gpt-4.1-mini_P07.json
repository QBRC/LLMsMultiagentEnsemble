  "comment": "The pathology report describes a 4.0 cm invasive moderately-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma in the left upper lobe of the lung with no invasion into the visceral pleura. Multiple lymph nodes from various stations including paratracheal, subcarinal, and lobar nodes were examined and found negative for malignancy, indicating no nodal metastasis. The bronchial resection margin is negative. The tumor is staged as T2a N0, corresponding to Stage IIA according to AJCC 7th edition criteria. The report indicates apparent complete resection of the tumor. No evidence of distant metastasis is provided. The certainty of tumor size and nodal status is high given the detailed examination. The pT category is estimated as T2a based on tumor size and absence of pleural invasion. Overall, the report is comprehensive and supports a confident staging and diagnosis. No critical issues noted."
