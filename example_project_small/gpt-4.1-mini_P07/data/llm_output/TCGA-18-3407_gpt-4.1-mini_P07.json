  "comment": "The pathology report describes a 4.0 cm invasive moderately-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma in the left upper lobe with no invasion into the visceral pleura. Multiple lymph nodes from various stations including paratracheal, subcarinal, and lobar nodes are negative for malignancy, indicating no nodal metastasis. The bronchial resection margin is negative. The tumor is staged as T2aN0, corresponding to Stage IB by AJCC 7th edition criteria. The report also notes nonspecific pleuropulmonary fibrosis and pulmonary emphysema. The diagnosis and staging appear complete and consistent with the findings. No evidence of distant metastasis is provided. The certainty of staging is high given the clear tumor size and negative lymph nodes. No critical issues noted."
