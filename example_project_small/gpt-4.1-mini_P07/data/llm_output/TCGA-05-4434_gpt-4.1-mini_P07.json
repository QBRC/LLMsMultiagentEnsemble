  "comment": "The pathology report describes an extensive, locoregionally advanced lung tumor in the right lower lobe with pleural invasion and lymph node metastases. The tumor is histologically a mixed adenocarcinoma confirmed by immunohistochemistry. The tumor is classified as pT4 due to pleural invasion and extensive spread, pN1 due to regional lymph node involvement, and pM1 due to malignant pleural effusions, resulting in an overall Stage IV classification per AJCC 7th edition. Tumor size is not provided. The report also notes the absence of squamous differentiation and confirms bronchopulmonary origin. The RX resection status indicates possible residual tumor cells in pleural effusions. Overall, the report is comprehensive and consistent, but the lack of tumor size measurement limits complete staging detail."
