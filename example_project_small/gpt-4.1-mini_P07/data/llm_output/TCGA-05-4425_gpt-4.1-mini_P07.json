  "comment": "The pathology report describes a peripheral bronchopulmonary mixed adenocarcinoma with pleural invasion and a satellite nodule considered a metastasis. The tumor is classified as pT2, pN0, and pM1 (pulmonary metastasis), resulting in Stage IV disease per AJCC7. Immunohistochemistry supports the diagnosis of lung adenocarcinoma. Tumor size is not provided. The R1 resection status indicates tumor cells at the pleural surface. Overall, the report provides sufficient information for staging except for tumor size, which remains unknown."
