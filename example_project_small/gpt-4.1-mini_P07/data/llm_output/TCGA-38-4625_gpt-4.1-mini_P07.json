  "comment": "The pathology report describes a poorly differentiated lung adenocarcinoma measuring 5.0 cm in greatest dimension located in the right upper lobe. The tumor is peripheral, abutting but not invading the pleura, and is 3.0 cm from the closest bronchial margin without bronchus involvement. Surgical margins are free of tumor. All examined lymph nodes (stations 7, 11, R4, and hilar) are negative for metastasis. No angiolymphatic or perineural invasion is identified. The tumor is high grade and markedly pleomorphic. Based on tumor size and absence of nodal involvement, the tumor is staged as T2a N0, corresponding to Stage IB by AJCC 7th edition criteria. The report is comprehensive and provides sufficient data for accurate staging. No evidence of pleural invasion or distant metastasis is noted. The absence of lymph node metastasis is well documented. Overall, the report supports a diagnosis of Stage IB lung adenocarcinoma with clear margins and no nodal spread."
