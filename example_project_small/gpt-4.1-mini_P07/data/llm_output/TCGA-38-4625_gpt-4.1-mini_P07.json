  "comment": "The pathology report describes a poorly differentiated lung adenocarcinoma measuring 5.0 cm in greatest dimension located in the right upper lobe. The tumor is peripheral, circumscribed, and abutting but not invading the pleura. Surgical margins are free of tumor. No lymph node metastases were identified in multiple sampled stations (hilar, 7, 11, R4). There is no evidence of angiolymphatic or perineural invasion. Based on tumor size and nodal status, the tumor is staged as T2a N0, corresponding to Stage IB by AJCC 7th edition criteria. The report is comprehensive and provides sufficient data for accurate staging. No distant metastasis information is provided, so M category and overall stage IV cannot be assessed. Overall, the report supports a diagnosis of Stage IB lung adenocarcinoma with negative margins and lymph nodes."
