  "comment": "The pathology report describes a moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma in the left lower lobe lung with a maximum tumor diameter of 4.7 cm. The tumor invades peribronchial fatty tissue and lobar bronchus but no lymph node metastases were identified in multiple sampled lymph nodes including interlobar, lobar, segmental, and aorta-pulmonary stations. Bronchial resection margin was initially positive but negative on completion pneumonectomy. The tumor is staged as pT2N0, corresponding to Stage IIA by AJCC 7th edition criteria. The report is comprehensive with detailed gross and microscopic findings. The only minor limitation is the lack of explicit mention of distant metastasis evaluation, but clinical history and lymph node sampling suggest no distant spread. Overall, the data supports a moderately advanced localized squamous cell carcinoma with no nodal involvement."
